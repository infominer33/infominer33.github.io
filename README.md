# Readme

I'm a curator, research enthusiast, and a good old fashioned computer nerd. 

I love web technology, and all the awesome tools available to learn. What other industry has so many free opportunities to learn and grow business and community in almost any direction you want to go?  All you need is a keyboard and a connection.

But there's no real clear path to follow... only possibility.

Well, there are some paths that have been laid, but I hope to clear out som trails, and make some of it easier to navigate as I develop my own possibilities.
