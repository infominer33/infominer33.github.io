Like most people, I found crypto first. After a while some of the hype began to wear off, and I realized that all of these cryptocurrencies are trying to rise off of the success of Bitcoin. I began to focus a lot more on learning about Bitcoin, but still treated Bitcoin as part of the greater ecosystem of crypto projects. 

While that approach was fine in the beginning, I started feeling that Bitcoin wasn't getting the proper attention, mixed in with all of my crypto-content. I also decided to get a lot more serious about Curating Bitcoin.

## Practical Bitcoin Info

One of my first really big projects around Bitcoin was to gather all the tools and practical information about Bitcoin into a google sheet. I decided the most well organized content I'd found online was *about* Bitcoin, and thought I could help make the information related to using Bitcoin easier to find. 

There are two tabs, one for Bitcoin and one for the Lightning Network.

## [Bitcoinfo.xyz](https://bitcoinfo.xyz/)

Then, I began pulling all of my Bitcoin History from the [SourceCrypto](https://sourcecrypto.github.io) website, and made an organization on Github to organize all my Bitcoin related content and forked repositories.

While these can be found in the bitcoinfo website, bitcoin-history used to have its own independent website, with some followers on github, so I stripped that down to just the markdown files, to let that resource continue it's distinct life.

## What's Next?

All in all, this is just the beginning of my inquiry into Bitcoin and related areas of study. It's a deep subject, requiring extra attention.

Bitcoinfo could use some work in the way of, originally it was just a collection of links that I had saved, which didn't really address the breadth of the subject.
