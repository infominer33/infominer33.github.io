[Kaliya Identity Woman](https://identitywoman.net/) and I have been casually collaborating on various projects in decentralized identity for over a year. Besides the occasional contract work, condensing our collected research and insight, Kaliya has also served as something of an advisor for the content created at [Decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com).

Her decades of experience in digital identity have played a crucial role in my ability to keep track of what's important relative to what's emerging today, and continually shares her expertise, which I'm able to expand upon for general consumption.

## The Origins of Self Sovereign Identity

My first project working with Kaliya involved writing a chapter for the upcoming book on Self Sovereign Identity being published by Manning Press. 

### [Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity)  
**Decentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials**, edited by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed.

* [16 The origins of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://livebook.manning.com/book/self-sovereign-identity/chapter-16)

Our chapter covers the history of Self Sovereign Identity, a subject I've written deeply upon, previously, and Kaliya has personally experienced the bulk of, helping greatly to fill in gaps that my relentless internet research skills weren't able to uncover, alone.

## Identosphere Blogcatcher

Our first project under the Identosphere brand is the Identity Blogcatcher. This is a collection of blog feeds organized by category, that enable us to keep track of what's happening in the decentralized identity space.

* [Identosphere Blogcatcher](https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/) - Personal Blogs
* [Identosphere Organizations Feed](https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/) - Blog feeds from ID related orgs.
* [Identosphere Companies Blogcatcher](https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/) - Blog feeds from companies in DID space.

In addition to the blogcatchers, I also set up a twitter search script, as I described [in a recent blog post](https://infominer.xyz/still-plugging-away/). These tools provide a system that we are in complete control over, that enable us to keep track of the information and news cycle in decentralized identity. 

Using the blogcatcher and the twitter scraper, as the foundation, we've begun a weekly newsletter sharing regular updates in decentralized identity.
