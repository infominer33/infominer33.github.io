The quest for truth and understanding is the longest running thread in my life. 

During my earliest years, I embraced passionate beliefs. Those beliefs had quite the problem co-existing with my other passion: reading.

There's something strange about many of the things I've been taught over the years. The more I studied, the less any of it made sense. Not only that, no-one wanted to talk about it. 

Gradually, I found that there *was no* firm intellectual basis for the beliefs I embraced, or those espoused by others. Rather, the firmest intellectual foundation I could grasp was entirely opposed to nearly everything taken as self-evident.

As a big reader from a young age, it was easy for me to feel that the educational system was just as baseless as everything else I was raised to believe in. It also came to appear that faith in my government and other powerful institutions would be as useful as believing in the Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy. 

While my youth was intellectually stimulating, it suffered socially, and I really had no glue sticking me to the herd.

## Dropping Out 

I saw everything as pointless, as "*the system*" seems to have developed quite the defense mechanism protecting it from meaningful remediation.

Why bother even living in a world that's built on lies intended to create slaves who think they are free? Where children are cajoled into choosing career-path before they know anything about the world. Then make sure it takes every ounce of energy to survive and potentially thrive. That way no-one has any thought or energy for personal development, or to take a moment of self-reflection.

It also helps if you make taboo the most natural subjects in the world that no-one could avoid. If you simultaniously repress and promote the same instincts, that keeps people pretty mixed up too. Oh yeah, why not, if there is anything undeniably good, it's important to inject some propaganda and other subtle devices.. that really keeps people on their toes! Why not also encourage people to fight against eachother for superficial reasons, and make the important issues as difficult as possible?

In the proceeding years, I grew bitter and indolent. 

## Reboot

Ok, I'm still kinda bitter (you noticed?), and recovering from over a decade of alcoholism... so I'm still kinda prickly, and not too social. I'm quite in the midst of this really intense process of re-birth.

Recently, I came across the work of Jordan Peterson, that has helped to shine a new light, and offers sorely needed perspective on this mixed up world. You may also find it helpful, so I'll leave this here.

He's pretty deep into mythology and philosophy, and just what I needed to round out my own thoughts on those subjects.

## Staying Busy 

I keep busy, rebuilding my life from the ground up.. and since I love reading more than anything else, I decided I should build a career out of that, somehow. 

I think organizing information is the most interesting and important work that I could do. I'm not waiting around for some algorithm to figure it out.

How should anyone decide what to do if they don't know the options?

I'm not I'm not interested in gimmicks, or easy ways to earn... I'm just laying a foundation so that I won't have to think about how to make money, but instead pick through the options available with an entirely new skillset. 

For the time being, I'm just collecting links, learning some [web-work fundamentals](https://web-work.tools), and picking up some gigs here and there to subsidise my education.

## Not about Me

I'm not interested in promoting myself, even this cartoon me. 

Id rather prove value in the quality of my work. Rather than promote myself as a product, I'm building a product around sharing information. I'm told if you need to promote, then the product isn't ready. I like that, and so will keep building.  Right now it's mostly lists of curated links... eventually I'd like to build out content for all of it, but still getting my bearings, and ignore everything else if I have a deadline in front of me.

It's coming along, though, and I expect to see a lot of good stuff here, over the coming year.

## That's it!

I'm still learning about myself, and the world, and rough around the edges.

This page is something like a public journal... trying to open up a bit...

Thanks for reading.
