### A Seeker

The quest for truth and understanding is the longest running thread in my life. This came about because I held passionate beliefs, from a young age. 

Having passionate beliefs is quite the problem for someone who's also passionate about information.

I found that there was something funny about the things I was taught, as a child. The more I studied, the less they made sense. Not only that, no-one wanted to talk about it. 

Gradually, I found that there *was* *no* firm intellectual basis for the beliefs I embraced, or was handed by others. Rather, the firmest intellectual foundation I could grasp was entirely opposed to nearly everything I was taught.

As a big reader from a young age, it was easy for me to feel that the educational system was just as baseless as everything else I was raised to believe in. It also came to appear that faith in my government and other powerful institutions would be as useful as believing in the Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy. 

While my youth was intellectually stimulating, it suffered socially. As a result, I really had no glue sticking me to the herd. Everyone was supposed to want a white picket fence, 2.5 kids, and a fancy car. That didn't seem interesting to me.

## Dropping Out 

I saw everything as pointless, including activism where you can clearly see that "the system" has a built-in defense mechanism protecting it from meaningful remediation.

What is the point to living in a world built on lies intended to create slaves who think they are free? Where children are cajoled into choosing career-path before they know anything about the world.

Then make sure it takes every ounce of energy to survive and potentially thrive. That way no-one has any thought or energy for personal development, or to take a moment of self-reflection.

Over the following years, I grew bitter and indolent.

## Reboot

Ok, I'm still kinda bitter, and recovering from over a decade of alcoholism.. so I'm still kinda prickly, and not too social.

I'm busy rebuilding my life from the ground up.. and since I love reading more than anything else, I decided I should build a career out of that, somehow. 

I think organizing information is the most important work that I could do. I'm not waiting around for some algorithm to figure it out.

How should anyone decide what to do if they don't know the options? 

I'm not looking for the quickest or easiest ways to earn... Right now, I'm just picking up gigs to subsidize my education.

## Not about Me

People place too much value in physical appearance. I'm not interested in promoting myself, even this cartoon me. I'd rather be useful and productive than popular.

Id rather prove value in the quality of my work. Rather than try to promote my own self as a product, I will make a product around sharing information so compelling that it simply can't be ignored.

## That's it!

I'm still learning about myself, and the world, and rough around the edges.

I guess this page is something like a public journal.. I'm trying to open up a bit, and remember...

Thanks for reading.
