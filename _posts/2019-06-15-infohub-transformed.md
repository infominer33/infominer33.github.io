## Welcome !!!

This summer, I decided to break apart my web-content to various domains and github organizations. The purpose is to develop distinct concentrated informational resources on a diverse range of topics.

For ease of navigation, enhanced growth potential, and in support of their original collaborative intent, I have split my github repositories into 4 organizations.

## New Organizational Structure

Now all of my content, and forked repositories, are divided among 4 organizations and my user account. Part of the benefit of arranging them so, is that I can make use of multiple custom domains, which the other repositories build off of like they have infominer.id.

I expect some will ultimately participate with the creation of these resources, and others will simply gather information, perhaps publishing their own independent resources using this content as a starting point. 

Regardless of what anyone else does, I will keep building. I like playing around with the names, and trying out different ideas. These projects tend to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.
