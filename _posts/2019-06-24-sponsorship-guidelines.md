Perhaps you've browsed these sites and wondered about contributing, but aren't sure where to start. In this post, we'll go over the simplest ways to contribute, as a broad overview.

This lays the foundation for detailed guides for these onramps. It might feel intimidating to try and learn GitHub, but I assure you its a web-site with buttons and menus like any other.

Discord is a lot of fun to use, if you've been locked away in slack silos, this may come as a refreshing change. You never have to pay to read the channel history, and only sign up one time to use any Discord server, unlike Slack. The UX is awesome, and it's accessible for developers and anyone who likes google search for figuring out how to hack together cool integrations.

## On GitHub

I welcome any issues or pull requests for question, comments, or contributions of any type. Its too early for strictly defined content that would not be accepted, but to be simple:

* We are seeking "source grade content" which is the foundation by which curious readers can explore the topic as close to its source as possible.
  * Content that aggregates numerous sources to convey a complex topic in a simple fashion is also quite welcome.
* If there are a ton of links to secondary sources and few or no links to quality source material, then its not a good fit.
  * We're not in the habit of syndicating a typical (low value) blog post. If we syndicate a blog post, it's gonna be epic.
* No Spam
  * No Ref Links
  * No ICOs (unless its about the announcement for a project that started in 2015 or earlier, or is from a major multinational corporation.)
  * Rules are made to be broken, in specific instances, when incentives align.


That caveat aside, neither myself, nor any of these websites will be a shill. My rule is, if I wouldn't do it for free, then I won't do it for money. The same goes for contributing to this website: you can pay for my attention and focus, and for including content on the site, perhaps even be featured, but only if it's of a similar (or better) quality to what would be featured anyways.

### "Edit This Page" 

![](https://imgur.com/t0Si4aE.png)

Nearly every page, on each of the sites I operate has a section like this, where you can share or edit on GitHub.

Clicking that button takes you to the raw, unformatted version of the page on GitHub. If/when you are logged in to github, that puts you one click away from editing this page: look for the pencil icon on the right side, just above where the line-numbered raw file begins.  Clicking it will reload an take you to an editable version of the page, which proposes an update through github.  The monitor icon will open an editable change-proposal of the file in github desktop, or whatever code-editing software you have configured.  If you are new to github, you don't have to trouble yourself with "forks" and "pulls" and "commits"-- just think of it as a proposed update to a specific file, which you submit for review, and gets partially or fully accepted ("committed") by me.

Whether it's an actual improvement, fully functioning with proper markup, or simply a note intended for me to read and reject, it will be read and appreciated, even in the rare case it isn't directly helpful! Don't be afraid, even if your change isn't perfect: I'll try to accept it and include your "commits", which are github's way of recording your contribution. I'm not a "GitHub professional", but I take this seriously and I work at this day in and day out.

## If you all could just..

![](https://infominer.id/bookmark-donations/that-would-be-great.jpg)

If you would export me a copy of your bookmarks.... that would be great! After a while I'll make a few fine grained how-to. This is one of the simplest ways that nearly anyone could contribute. I want to create detailed guides, to ensure that everyone is able.

## @ mention on twitter

You can simply @mention @didecentral on twitter, for anything essential, decentralized identity related. Soon, each organization within the InfoHub will have it's own Twitter account, and the history of each of those accounts will be preserved and republished on their respective websites in keeping with indieweb principles.

## Contributing Via Discord

Discord is, hands down, my favorite way to collaborate with contributors informally. If you've never used it before, Discord is a powerful, free-to-use, closed-source communication/collaboration platform like Slack or Telegram, originally designed for the gaming community but since popular with opensource projects and startups. You can see if you read around in the snapshot I recently published here of the contents of the [SourceCrypto Discord Server](https://SourceCrypto.pub/discolog/) that I use Discord as a kind of open and social blotter for ideas, links, and resources. I share posts to the channels of various discord servers I operate, throughout my day, on the fly... mostly on smoke breaks. Many others contribute links too, and even responses like, "Oooh, glad you found this," or, "This article is hard to understand," can be quite helpful in knowing how to write up guides and overviews. 

I'll by adding more details to this page, like tips and tricks for each mode of contribution, in the coming weeks.

### 4 Organizations

These links lead to the posts, also found via my homepage. This way, I can announce updates, and show off featured content, for each of the organizations, as they develop.

* [DIDecentral](/identity-decentralized/)
* [Web-work.tools](/web-work-tools/)
  * [Indieweb](/web-work-tools/#web-work-toolsindieweb)
* [SourceCrypto](/source-crypto/)
  * [Bitcoin History](/source-crypto/#bitcoin-history)
  * [Crypto Transcripts](/source-crypto/#transcripts)
* [Learn Crypto Trading](/LCT-learn-crypto-trading/)

There are a few more web-sites under development, which you can discover by browsing the Organizations on GitHub.
