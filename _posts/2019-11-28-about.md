I was a total computer nerd growing up, but then decided that technology was but one of a multitude of potential material pursuits. I took off to pursue meaning, which took me off the grid for quite some time. A decadent decade later, I had screwed up my life enough to need a re-boot.

I decided to make a go at working online, perhaps as a writer, on account of my love for the written word. Well, I hadn't spent much time with the written word in a while, and I barely knew anything about topics of interest. When I got hired to write, I spent inordinate amounts of time doing background research. I might spend hours looking for a proper source, since I didn't know anything, I needed sources.

Well, the problem with this is that people on the web are really bad at citing sources. I suppose you can do that if you know something already, just write what you know to be true, and let someone else worry about the sources.

I got fed up with all the vacuous content that dominated my search results, and decided to start keeping track of valuable information. Since I used only a fraction of my research for the actual content I was preparing, I could keep a list of source material on various subjects until I needed to write about them.

Then I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it's a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love making curated lists a lot more than I like writing. 

I've come to see curated lists as the gold of the internet. Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that's even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?

Then I thought "what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest." This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but no-one really tackling the problem head on.

Automation is just eating up jobs left and right, curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can't automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.

That's what I'm working on, cause it seems like this huge gap in the market that nobody is really paying attention to.

I see curation as this huge economy just waiting to explode... and maybe I can help give it a kickstart by showing what somone can do in a few years starting without a modern skillset, only the desire to organize information.
