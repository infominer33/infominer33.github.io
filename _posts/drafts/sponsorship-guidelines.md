## On GitHub

I welcome any issues or pull requests for question, comments, or contributions of any type. Its too early for strictly defined content that would not be accepted, but to be simple:

* We are seeking "source grade content" which is the foundation by which curious readers can explore the topic as close to its source as possible.
  * Content that aggregates numerous sources to convey a complex topic in a simple fashion is also quite welcome.
* If there are a ton of links to secondary sources and few or no links to quality source material, then its not a good fit.
  * We're not in the habit of syndicating a typical (low value) blog post. If we syndicate a blog post, it's gonna be epic.
* No Spam
  * No Ref Links
  * No ICOs (unless its about the announcement for a project that started in 2015 or earlier, or is from a major multinational corporation.)
  * Rules are made to be broken, in specific instances, when incentives align.


That caveat aside, neither myself, nor any of these websites will be a shill. My rule is, if I wouldn't do it for free, then I won't do it for money. The same goes for contributing to this website: you can pay for my attention and focus, and for including content on the site, perhaps even be featured, but only if it's of a similar (or better) quality to what would be featured anyways.
