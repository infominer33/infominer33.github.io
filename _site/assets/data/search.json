  "content"  : "I became captivated with computers in the early ’90s, as the world wide web began to emerge. I was a total computer nerd, but never took it seriously. I had no conception of how the world would be transformed, and ultimately decided that technology was simply one of many potential material pursuits. I took off to pursue meaning, which landed me off-grid for a bulk of the time. After a decade of indolence, I needed a re-boot.\n\n\n\nThe world had become transformed. It was clear I could have done almost anything, if I had stayed with my love for tech, I would be a lot further ahead in life by now.\n\nAll the same, I see that the world has still just begun its digital transformation, and opportunity abounds.\n\nI decided to make a go at working online, perhaps as a writer, on account of my love for reading, and aquiring quality information. Somehow, I thought, If I could get paid to read… Now, that would be the ticket!\n\nI hadn’t spent much time with the written word in a while, and I didn’t know anything about the modern tech landscape. I started by learning some markdown, and practiced blogging. My style was rough, to begin with, but my dedication to information landed me some content gigs related to bitcoin and data science.\n\nI got fed up with all the vacuous content that dominated my search results, and decided to start keeping track of valuable information. Since I used only a fraction of my research for the actual content I was preparing, I could keep a list of source material on various subjects until I needed to write about them.\n\nThen I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it’s a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love making curated lists a lot more than I like writing.\n\nI’ve come to see curated lists as the gold of the internet. Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that’s even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?\n\nThen I thought “what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest.” This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but it seems no-one is really tackling the problem head on.\n\nAutomation is just eating up jobs left and right, while curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can’t automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.\n\nI see curation as this huge economy just waiting to explode… and maybe I can help give it a kickstart by showing what somone can do in a few years starting without a capital or a modern skillset, only a bit of runway and the desire to share their self-educational experience with the world.\n\nSo i’m just picking up chunks of gold off the ground, metaphorically speaking, before the rush…\n"

  "content"  : "Note: Repost from SourceCrypto, with an infohub subscriptions form.\n\nIn the Summer of 2018, I had a seemingly foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. I began doing so, creating channels for a variety of topics I began collecting links in a discord server, for eventul addition to a database of some sort.\n\n\n\nMy interests are varied, and eventually I saw that I should make new servers to adequately treat each subject. Between a dozen discord servers, and a handful of twitter accounts, I’ve been seriously retweeting, sharing to focused channels, organizing, archiving and otherwise keeping track of valuable information that would otherwise slip away… into the abyss of the intellect… along with all the other interesting things I’ve read, but didn’t keep references for, over the years.\n\nA Collaborative Workflow?\n\nA year later, the idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin still seems foolish. Perhaps not so much as it did when I began. I never assumed that I could actually accomplish my task, but I felt it was important to act and believe as though it was possible.\n\nI’ve only gotten serious about tech in the past few years, and have had quite a steep learning curve to catch up. To begin, I had a little experience maintaining Discord servers, and appreciate it’s UX, so it made sense for me to start there, rather than starting by seeking the ideal solution.\n\nIt’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning. I have appreciated a number of contributors over that time, but the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not been very social, or acted as an effective community organizer. Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.\n\nFOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism\n\nOver the past year, I’ve gone deeper and deeper into the world of Bitcoin, FOSS, Indieweb, Decentralized Identity, standards organizations, working groups and mailing lists. I’ve studied histories surrounding AI, Decentralized Web, Cyberpunks, Cypherpunks, MIT hackers, Sovereign Identity, Cryptography, and other histories of computing and the internet.\n\nThe irony of using discord and twitter while laying a foundation for a FOSS principled collaborative curation platform is not lost on me. Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter was an essential component of my education. Despite it’s shortcomings, there is plenty of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nIt’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.\n\nI’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a little better before dismissing it altogether (my inclination). Spreadsheets are extensible, and an ideal stepping stone, between the archives and a variety of applications.\n\nI’ve also begun to experiment with Notion as a power tool. It allows me to import the individual html files of the archives, transform them into a single page, and then export them to markdown, from which it’s managable to transform into a simple page of links organized by category, and from there to spreadsheets.\n\nUltimately, I think a wiki of curated lists is a solid direction to generally aim towards.\n\nSubscribe for Updates\n\nThis post is meant to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media. Over the past year, I created a dozen servers, and half as many twitter accounts, github organizations, websites… I have just been going full blast, trying to make up for lost time. I got rid of most of the discord servers, including the original SourceCrypto server, and have been productive in moving forward.\n\nThat’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new apps, and take it all to the next level.\n\nThis is the third e-mail list I’m setting up.\n\nI have one also for SourceCrypto, and DIDecentral. These are only for major updates, and I haven’t even sent out the first e-mail, since I’m still learning of the different ways to introduce forms on a static site.\n\nInfoHub Updates\n\n\n  \n    \n      Don’t fill this out if you&#39;re human: \n      \n    \n  \n  Your email address\n  \n    \n    Subscribe\n  \n\n"

  "content"  : "\n\nWelcome !!!\n\nThis site began as a few markdown files in a github repository, and gradually became my homepage. I have a range of interests that deserve the room to grow as distinct projects, and it’s good practice for me to create new sites. So, this summer, I decided to break apart my web-content to various domains and github organizations. The purpose is to develop distinct concentrated informational resources on a diverse range of topics.\n\n\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nNow all of my content, and forked repositories, are divided among 4 organizations and my user account. Part of the benefit of arranging them so, is that I can make use of multiple custom domains, which the other repositories build off of like they have infominer.id.\n\nI look forward to others participating with the creation of these resources, and appreciate that others may quietly gather resources for their own projects.\n\nRegardless of what anyone else does, I will keep building. I like playing around with the names, and trying out different ideas. These projects tend to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.\n\nPortfolio\n\n\n  DIDecentral -discord chat\n  Web-work.tools\n    \n      Indieweb\n    \n  \n  SourceCrypto\n    \n      Bitcoin History\n      Crypto Transcripts\n    \n  \n  Learn Crypto Trading\n\n\nThere are a few more web-sites under development, which you can discover by browsing the Organizations on GitHub.\n\nThe transformation\n\nThis page will keep growing, and is meant to be a top level index of my projects…\n"

One had me write higher level introductory pieces for developers, to be included as part of their training courses for various Hyperledger and other blockchain training. Indy was one that really captured my interest.\n\nOver a few months worth of gigs, I had amassed quite a collection of information related to decentralized identity efforts. Around November, started building infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id, inspired by the awesome lists.\n\nDecentralized-ID has become a passion, but so has publishing content via GitHub pages. DIDecentralized is my most highly developed research project, to-date. I will continue to build and try new ways of sharing diverse related information.\n\nToday, we are closer than ever to a human first approach to identification online.\n\nThis sector has also exploded over its potential as a breakthrough application for blockchain, beyond currency. Efforts to create a decentralized identity layer for the internet have persevered since the early 2000’s, experiencing surge of energy with the rise of Bitcoin, the GDPR, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for all to have legal id by 2030.

  "content"  : "In August of 2018, I began collecting links related to blockchain, in the channels of a discord server, which rapidly multiplied. At the time, I advertised content creation services on a popular freelance site, attracting mostly enterprise blockchain types.\n\nPersonally, I never found permissioned blockchains very interesting. However, I enjoy getting paid to learn. I also appreciate learning about the market through the eyes of my clients.\n\nI’m a Bitcoiner at heart, but that doesn’t stop me from being interested in blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Since ‘blockchain’ is such a massive space, I began by studying the history surrounding Bitcoin. For me, it’s important to understand the events and conditions leading to Bitcoin, before presuming to know anything about cryptocurrency.\n\nI’m almost caught up enough to take a solid stab at the actual history of Bitcoin, which naturally leads to the history of cryptocurrency. It’s quite likely that I’ll explode into stardust, once I begin working on the years since 2017.\n\nBefore all that happens, I’d like to have a site dedicated to Bitcoin only, early 2020.\n\nAfter a year and a half of full-time dedicated curation, I’ve decided to drop the discord servers, and move on to more sophisticated tools.\n\n\n  Reflections: Stepping Back and Moving Forward\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin\n\n\n  Down the @TheCryptoconomy Rabbithole - Essential Bitcoin Literature in Audio Format\n  Running Bitcoin: Tools, Apps and Guides\n  LightniNgFo: Wallets, Applications, Guides and Development\n\n\nBitcoin History\n\n\n  Electronic Cash and Virtual Currencies, Before Bitcoin\n  Cypherpunks and the Crypto Wars\n  Blockchain and the United Nations\n  History of Permissioned Ledgers\n\n\nTranscripts\n\nAround a year ago, I started making transcripts for content that I felt was too valuable to be left in audio format only.

  "content"  : "The more you are able to leverage digital tools, the greater your potential in the digital world. The easiest tools have a graphical interface, and the really good ones cost money. But gaining familiarity with your terminal applications is where the power is at. You don’t have to be a developer to learn how to use their tools and gain access to features that otherwise would cost an arm and a leg. This is the edge.\n\nYour physical efforts with a desktop application, having 0 barrier to entry, is a commodity.\n\nDigital tools are a force multiplier.\n\nNot only command-line tools.

Every executive worth their salt knows that anyone with an internet connection has the potential to decimate their entire industry, with some new disintermediating product or service.\n\nRecall, that some of the largest corporations existing today were built in a garage.\n\nThe enterprise has considerable resources devoted to undergoing their own digital transformation, to distrupt their own business models before someone else does it for them.\n\nNow, the independent would-be worker of the web isn’t likely to know all of this. When I began, all I knew is that it’s clearly possible to work online, not only that, it’s practically inevitable.\n\nToday there is an endless array of useful tools and apps that you and I can learn to create value with.
