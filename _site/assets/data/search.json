  "content"  : "It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward. I’ve also been busy leveling up, and discovering my potential.\n\nSo what exactly have I doing with all that time?\n\n\n\nManaging Emotions\n\nIf you haven’t been following my story, so far, the short version is that I quit drinking a few years ago, and all of this info-gathering has been an important part of my recovery process, and a path to creating a new life.\n\nAll the same, however far along I had come in my work, and self-education, I still had the challenges processing every day emotions, which I’d been primarily avoiding by processing as much information on valuable topics as possible.\n\nTurning that around, I shifted most of my info-gathering from blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized-identity, to focus more on mental hygiene and emotional agility.\n\nThe most valuable information I’ve encountered in that regard is Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication.\n\n\n  We’re interested, in nonviolent communication, with the kind of honesty that supports people connecting with each other in a way that makes compassionate giving inevitable, that makes it enjoyable for people to contribute to each other’s well being. - Marshall Rosenberg\n\n\nI’ve got a couple projects brewing on that topic, and will write more about that later, so don’t want to take too much space for that now.\n\nIn brief, I can say that spending time with the teachings of Marshall Rosenberg has made a significant contribution to my mental health and emotional wellbeing.\n\nIf you’re curious to learn more, I called a session at my first IIW on the topic, you can check out the notes for that session on the IIW Wiki, which provides a high-level overview, and lots of links.\n\nDeveloping the backend for a sustainable weekly newsletter\n\nI’d been chatting with Kaliya Identity Woman for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the Identosphere.net domain.\n\nInstead of jumping in head first, like I usually do, we’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter, sustainably, with as few third party services as possible, while I’m learning my way around various web-tools.\n\nWe’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and I’d like to share this process for others to benefit from.\n\nGitHub Pages\n\nI started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awsome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.\n\n\n  GitHub Pages Starter Pack  (a resource I’ve created along that journey)\n\n\nStatic Websites are great for security and easy to set up, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.\n\nEnter Staticman\n\nStaticman is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.\n\nIt can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server.  Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional mailgun integration).\n\nI set it up on my own server and created a bot account on GitHub with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.\n\nMade the form, and a staticman.yml config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.\n\nThe Subscription Form\n\n&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Subscribe for Updates&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;form class=&quot;staticman&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;options[redirect]&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;https://infominer.xyz/subscribed&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;options[slug]&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;infohub&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;fields[name]&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name (optional)&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;fields[email]&quot; type=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;fields[message]&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Areas of Interest (optional)&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;links&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; placeholder=&quot;links&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&amp;gt;Subscribe&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;\n\nThe staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo\n\nsubscribe:\n  allowedFields: [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, &quot;message&quot;]\n  allowedOrigins: [&quot;infominer.xyz&quot;,&quot;identosphere.net&quot;]\n  branch: &quot;master&quot;\n  commitMessage: &quot;New subscriber: {fields.name}&quot;\n  filename: &quot;subscribe-{@timestamp}&quot;\n  format: &quot;yaml&quot;\n  generatedFields:\n    date:\n      type: &quot;date&quot;\n      options:\n        format: &quot;iso8601&quot; \n  moderation: false\n  name: &quot;infominer.xyz&quot;\n  path: &quot;{options.slug}&quot; \n  requiredFields: [&quot;email&quot;]\n\n\nIt seems to be struggling with GitHub’s recent move to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.\n\nPlanet Pluto Feed Reader\n\nTrying to keep up with Self-Sovereign Identity, kaliya and I started out with Feedly, but the pricing for collaborative feed creation is nearly $50 a month for two users. There was no way I could go with that for very long.\n\nOne of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is Planet Pluto Feed Reader, by Gerald Bauer.\n\n\n  In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - Planet (Software)\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, I should add that websites generate RSS feeds that can be read by a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually. You very likely use RSS all the time without knowing, for example, your podcast player depends on RSS feeds to bring episodes directly to your phone.\n\nWhat Pluto Feed reader does is just like your podcast app, except, instead of an application on your phone that only you can browse, it builds a simple webpage from the feeds you add to it, that can be published on GitHub, your favorite static web-hosting service, or on your own server in the cloud.\n\n\n\nPluto is built with Ruby, using the ERB templating language for web-page design.\n\nOne of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.\n\nFeed Search\n\nI use the RSSHub Radar browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.\n\nI found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.\n\nAs you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install Python, install the package with pip (pip install feedsearch-crawler), and type python at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.\n\nFrom there you can type\\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type python feedsearch.py,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.\n\nDepending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.\n\nFeedsearch Crawler\n\n\n  DBeath/feedsearch-crawler\n\n\nfrom feedsearch_crawler import search\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(filename=&#39;example.log&#39;,level=logging.DEBUG)\nimport output_opml\nlist = [&quot;http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/&quot;,&quot;http://blockchainespana.com/&quot;,&quot;http://blog.deanland.com/&quot;]\nfor items in list:\n    feeds = search(items)\n    output_opml(feeds).decode()\n    logger = logging.getLogger(&quot;feedsearch_crawler&quot;)\n\n\nFeed seeker\n\n\n  mitmedialab/feed_seeker\n\n\nfrom feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls\nlist = [&quot;http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/&quot;,&quot;http://blockchainespana.com/&quot;,&quot;http://blog.deanland.com/&quot;]\nfor items in list:\n    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):\n        print(url)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\n\nPluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used GitHub actions.\n\nThis is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.\n\nname: Build BlogCatcher\non:\n  schedule:\n    # This action runs 4x a day.\n    - cron:  &#39;0/60 */4 * * *&#39;\n  push:\n    paths:\n    # It also runs whenever I add a new feed to Pluto&#39;s config file.\n    - &#39;planetid.ini&#39;\njobs:\n  updatefeeds:\n    # Install Ubuntu\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    # Access my project repo to apply updates after pluto runs\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Set up Ruby\n      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        ruby-version: 2.6\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      # Download and install SQLite (needed for Pluto), then delete downloaded installer\n      run: | \n        wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/sqlite3/libsqlite3-dev_3.22.0-1ubuntu0.4_amd64.deb\n        sudo dpkg -i libsqlite3-dev_3.22.0-1ubuntu0.4_amd64.deb\n        rm libsqlite3-dev_3.22.0-1ubuntu0.4_amd64.deb\n        gem install pluto &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gem install nokogiri &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gem install sanitize\n    - name: build blogcatcher # This is the command I use to build my pluto project\n      run: pluto b planetid.ini -t planetid -o docs\n    - name: Deploy Files # This one adds the updates to my project\n      run: |\n        git remote add gh-token &quot;https://github.com/identosphere/identity-blogcatcher.git&quot;\n        git config user.name &quot;github-actions[bot]&quot; \n        git config user.email &quot;41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com&quot;\n        git add .\n        git commit -a -m &quot;update blogcatcher&quot;\n        git pull\n        git push gh-token master\n\n\nIdentosphere Blogcatcher\n\n\n\nIdentosphere Blogcatcher (source) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original Planet Identity.\n\nWe also have a page for companies, and another for organizations working in the field.\n\nIdentosphere Weekly Highlights\n\nLast month, Kaliya suggested that since we have these pages up and running smoothly, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the backend information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.\n\nEvery weekend we get together, browse the BlogCatcher, and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.\n\nWe’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!\n\n\n\nThis newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.\n\nidentosphere.substack.com\n\nSetting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.\n\nIt has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.\n\nSupport us on Patreon\n\nWhile keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)\n\n\n\nSo far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.\n\nPython, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions\n\nSince we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.\n\nInstead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.\n\nI found a simple guide How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a yaml file, and then used GitHub actions to run the script on a regular schedule.\n\nWhile that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!\n\nDecentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections\n\nWith that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come back to Twitter, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.\n\nI made a script that searches twitter for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly twitter collection, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D\n\nSoon, these will be regularly published to decentralized-id.com, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \\ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.\n\nI do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.\n\nTwitter collections I’ve made so far\n\n\n  Self Sovereign ID 101\n  October Week 5 #SSI #DID\n  November Week 1 #SSI #DID\n\n\nDecentralized-ID.com\n\nNow we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing decentralized-id.com, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.\n\nThat said, I’ve not given up on Bitcoin, or Crypto. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.\n\nWeb-Work.Tools\n\nWith the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, web-work.tools was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.\n\nI updated GitHub Pages Starter Pack \\ Extended Resources quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.\n\nThanks for stopping by!\n\n\nSubscribe for Updates\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Subscribe\n\n\n"

  "content"  : "I became captivated with computers in the early ’90s, as the world wide web began to emerge. I was a total computer nerd, but never took it seriously. I had no conception of how the world would be transformed, and ultimately decided that technology was simply one of many potential material pursuits. I took off to pursue meaning, which landed me off-grid for a bulk of the time. After a decade of indolence, I needed a re-boot.\n\n\n\nThe world had become transformed. It was clear I could have done almost anything, if I had stayed with my love for tech, I would be a lot further ahead in life by now.\n\nAll the same, I see that the world has still just begun its digital transformation, and opportunity abounds.\n\nI decided to make a go at working online, perhaps as a writer, on account of my love for reading, and aquiring quality information. Somehow, I thought, If I could get paid to read… Now, that would be the ticket!\n\nI hadn’t spent much time with the written word in a while, and I didn’t know anything about the modern tech landscape. I started by learning some markdown, and practiced blogging. My style was rough, to begin with, but my dedication to information landed me some content gigs related to bitcoin and data science.\n\nI got fed up with all the vacuous content that dominated my search results, and decided to start keeping track of valuable information. Since I used only a fraction of my research for the actual content I was preparing, I could keep a list of source material on various subjects until I needed to write about them.\n\nThen I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it’s a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love making curated lists a lot more than I like writing.\n\nI’ve come to see curated lists as the gold of the internet. Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that’s even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?\n\nThen I thought “what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest.” This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but it seems no-one is really tackling the problem head on.\n\nAutomation is just eating up jobs left and right, while curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can’t automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.\n\nI see curation as this huge economy just waiting to explode… and maybe I can help give it a kickstart by showing what somone can do in a few years starting without a capital or a modern skillset, only a bit of runway and the desire to share their self-educational experience with the world.\n\nSo i’m just picking up chunks of gold off the ground, metaphorically speaking, before the rush…\n"

  "content"  : "Note: Repost from SourceCrypto, with an infohub subscriptions form.\n\nIn the Summer of 2018, I had a seemingly foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. I began doing so, creating channels for a variety of topics I began collecting links in a discord server, for eventul addition to a database of some sort.\n\n\n\nMy interests are varied, and eventually I saw that I should make new servers to adequately treat each subject. Between a dozen discord servers, and a handful of twitter accounts, I’ve been seriously retweeting, sharing to focused channels, organizing, archiving and otherwise keeping track of valuable information that would otherwise slip away… into the abyss of the intellect… along with all the other interesting things I’ve read, but didn’t keep references for, over the years.\n\nA Collaborative Workflow?\n\nA year later, the idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin still seems foolish. Perhaps not so much as it did when I began. I never assumed that I could actually accomplish my task, but I felt it was important to act and believe as though it was possible.\n\nI’ve only gotten serious about tech in the past few years, and have had quite a steep learning curve to catch up. To begin, I had a little experience maintaining Discord servers, and appreciate it’s UX, so it made sense for me to start there, rather than starting by seeking the ideal solution.\n\nIt’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning. I have appreciated a number of contributors over that time, but the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not been very social, or acted as an effective community organizer. Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.\n\nFOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism\n\nOver the past year, I’ve gone deeper and deeper into the world of Bitcoin, FOSS, Indieweb, Decentralized Identity, standards organizations, working groups and mailing lists. I’ve studied histories surrounding AI, Decentralized Web, Cyberpunks, Cypherpunks, MIT hackers, Sovereign Identity, Cryptography, and other histories of computing and the internet.\n\nThe irony of using discord and twitter while laying a foundation for a FOSS principled collaborative curation platform is not lost on me. Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter was an essential component of my education. Despite it’s shortcomings, there is plenty of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nIt’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.\n\nI’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a little better before dismissing it altogether (my inclination). Spreadsheets are extensible, and an ideal stepping stone, between the archives and a variety of applications.\n\nI’ve also begun to experiment with Notion as a power tool. It allows me to import the individual html files of the archives, transform them into a single page, and then export them to markdown, from which it’s managable to transform into a simple page of links organized by category, and from there to spreadsheets.\n\nUltimately, I think a wiki of curated lists is a solid direction to generally aim towards.\n\nSubscribe for Updates\n\nThis post is meant to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media. Over the past year, I created a dozen servers, and half as many twitter accounts, github organizations, websites… I have just been going full blast, trying to make up for lost time. I got rid of most of the discord servers, including the original SourceCrypto server, and have been productive in moving forward.\n\nThat’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new apps, and take it all to the next level.\n\nThis is the third e-mail list I’m setting up.\n\nI have one also for SourceCrypto, and DIDecentral. These are only for major updates, and I haven’t even sent out the first e-mail, since I’m still learning of the different ways to introduce forms on a static site.\n\n\nSubscribe for Updates\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Subscribe\n\n\n"

I have a range of interests that deserve the room to grow as distinct projects, and it’s good practice for me to create new sites. So, this summer, I decided to break apart my web-content to various domains and github organizations. The purpose is to develop distinct concentrated informational resources on a diverse range of topics.\n\n\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nNow all of my content, and forked repositories, are divided among 4 organizations and my user account. Part of the benefit of arranging them so, is that I can make use of multiple custom domains, which the other repositories build off of like they have infominer.id.\n\nI look forward to others participating with the creation of these resources, and appreciate that others may quietly gather resources for their own projects.\n\nRegardless of what anyone else does, I will keep building. I like playing around with the names, and trying out different ideas. These projects tend to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.\n\nPortfolio\n\n\n  DIDecentral -discord chat\n  Web-work.tools\n    \n      Indieweb\n    \n  \n  SourceCrypto\n    \n      Bitcoin History\n      Crypto Transcripts\n    \n  \n  Learn Crypto Trading\n\n\nThere are a few more web-sites under development, which you can discover by browsing the Organizations on GitHub.\n\nThe transformation\n\nThis page will keep growing, and is meant to be a top level index of my projects…\n"

  "content"  : "Like most people, I found crypto first. After a while some of the hype began to wear off, and I realized that all of these cryptocurrencies are trying to rise off of the success of Bitcoin. I began to focus a lot more on learning about Bitcoin, but still treated Bitcoin as part of the greater ecosystem of crypto projects.\n\nWhile that approach was fine in the beginning, I started feeling that Bitcoin wasn’t getting the proper attention, mixed in with all of my crypto-content. I also decided to get a lot more serious about Curating Bitcoin.\n\nPractical Bitcoin Info\n\nOne of my first really big projects around Bitcoin was to gather all the tools and practical information about Bitcoin into a google sheet. I decided the most well organized content I’d found online was about Bitcoin, and thought I could help make the information related to using Bitcoin easier to find.\n\nThere are two tabs, one for Bitcoin and one for the Lightning Network.\n\n\n  Practical Bitcoin Info\n\n\nBitcoinfo.xyz\n\nThen, I began pulling all of my Bitcoin History from the SourceCrypto website, and made an organization on Github to organize all my Bitcoin related content and forked repositories.\n\n\n  Bitcoinfo GitHub organization\n\n\nBitcoinfo Practical\n\n\n  Info + Best Practices · Bitcoin Security\n  Paper, Mobile, Desktop, and Hardware · Bitcoin Wallets and Utilities\n  Tools and Apps · Bitcoin Trading\n  🛰️ · Bitcoin Satellite Nodes\n  Earn or Buy, don’t borrow! · Get Bitcoin!!!!!\n  Validate the Blockchain · Bitcoin Full-Node\n  Books, Resources and other Guides · Programming with Bitcoin\n  Data data data · Bitcoin Data and Analytics\n  Leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain · Layer One Applications\n  Wallets, Applications, Guides and Development · Lightning Network Info\n\n\nBitcoin History\n\n\n  Satoshi Nakamoto the Pseudonymous Creator of Bitcoin\n  Darknet Market Histories\n  Hacking and Hacker Culture.\n  Bitcoin History Curated\n  Histories of Digital Cryptography\n\n\nWhile these can be found in the bitcoinfo website, bitcoin-history used to have its own independent website, with some followers on github, so I stripped that down to just the markdown files, to let that resource continue it’s distinct life.\n\n\n  bitcoinfo/history\n\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nAll in all, this is just the beginning of my inquiry into Bitcoin and related areas of study. It’s a deep subject, requiring extra attention.\n\nBitcoinfo could use some work in the way of, originally it was just a collection of links that I had saved, which didn’t really address the breadth of the subject.\n\n"

  "content"  : "When I was first learning the freelance writing market, a number of clients hired me to write and research blockchain id. One had me write higher level introductory pieces for developers, to be included as part of their training courses for various Hyperledger and other blockchain training. Indy was one that really captured my interest.\n\nOver a few months worth of gigs, I had amassed quite a collection of information related to decentralized identity efforts. Around November, started building infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id, inspired by the awesome lists.\n\nDecentralized-ID has become a passion, but so has publishing content via GitHub pages. DIDecentralized is my most highly developed research project, to-date. I will continue to build and try new ways of sharing diverse related information.\n\nToday, we are closer than ever to a human first approach to identification online.\n\nThis sector has also exploded over its potential as a breakthrough application for blockchain, beyond currency. Efforts to create a decentralized identity layer for the internet have persevered since the early 2000’s, experiencing surge of energy with the rise of Bitcoin, the GDPR, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for all to have legal id by 2030. Plus.. Canadian governments are using a distributed ledger for their business registry, which will support a ton of useful technologies!!!!\n\n\n\nDecentralized ID - Featured\n\n\n  decentralized-id.com —Epic repository of DID and SSI Resources.\n    \n      SSI Related Github Repositories\n      Rebooting Web of Trust - Papers and Advance Readings Index\n      Microledgers and Edge-Chains—Daniel Hardman, Evernym - Transcript\n      Verifiable Organizations Network: A Production Government Deployment of Hyperledger Indy - Transcript\n    \n  \n\n\nDIDecentral, (formerly infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id) was originally created on November 11, 2018.\n\nThat’s also when I began learning to use GitHub and Git.\n\n\n\nIdentosphere - Planet Identity Reboot\n\nThis project was inspired by the original planetidentity.org Identity Management feed aggregator.\n\n\n\n\n  Planet (Software)\n    \n      In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe Pluto feed-reader is pretty awesome, and makes building webpages with rss feeds a lot of fun.\n"

  "content"  : "Kaliya Identity Woman and I have been casually collaborating on various projects in decentralized identity for over a year. Besides the occasional contract work, condensing our collected research and insight, Kaliya has also served as something of an advisor for the content created at Decentralized-id.com.\n\nHer decades of experience in digital identity have played a crucial role in my ability to keep track of what’s important relative to what’s emerging today, and continually shares her expertise, which I’m able to expand upon for general consumption.\n\nThe Origins of Self Sovereign Identity\n\nMy first project working with Kaliya involved writing a chapter for the upcoming book on Self Sovereign Identity being published by Manning Press.\n\nSelf-Sovereign Identity\nDecentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials, edited by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed.\n\n\n\n\n  16 The origins of Self-Sovereign Identity\n\n\nOur chapter covers the history of Self Sovereign Identity, a subject I’ve written deeply upon, previously, and Kaliya has personally experienced the bulk of, helping greatly to fill in gaps that my relentless internet research skills weren’t able to uncover, alone.\n\nIdentosphere Blogcatcher\n\n\n\nOur first project under the Identosphere brand is the Identity Blogcatcher. This is a collection of blog feeds organized by category, that enable us to keep track of what’s happening in the decentralized identity space.\n\n\n  Identosphere Blogcatcher - Personal Blogs\n  Identosphere Organizations Feed - Blog feeds from ID related orgs.\n  Identosphere Companies Blogcatcher - Blog feeds from companies in DID space.\n\n\nIdentosphere Weekly Highlights\n\n\n\nIn addition to the blogcatchers, I also set up a twitter search script, as I described in a recent blog post. These tools provide a system that we are in complete control over, that enable us to keep track of the information and news cycle in decentralized identity.\n\nUsing the blogcatcher and the twitter scraper, as the foundation, we’ve begun a weekly newsletter sharing regular updates in decentralized identity.\n\nRead the Identosphere Weekly and Subscribe Free Here!\n"

  "content"  : "In August of 2018, I began collecting links related to blockchain, in the channels of a discord server, which rapidly multiplied. At the time, I advertised content creation services on a popular freelance site, attracting mostly enterprise blockchain types.\n\nPersonally, I never found permissioned blockchains very interesting. However, I enjoy getting paid to learn. I also appreciate learning about the market through the eyes of my clients.\n\nI’m a Bitcoiner at heart, but that doesn’t stop me from being interested in blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Since ‘blockchain’ is such a massive space, I began by studying the history surrounding Bitcoin. For me, it’s important to understand the events and conditions leading to Bitcoin, before presuming to know anything about cryptocurrency.\n\nI’m almost caught up enough to take a solid stab at the actual history of Bitcoin, which naturally leads to the history of cryptocurrency. It’s quite likely that I’ll explode into stardust, once I begin working on the years since 2017.\n\nBefore all that happens, I’d like to have a site dedicated to Bitcoin only, early 2020.\n\nAfter a year and a half of full-time dedicated curation, I’ve decided to drop the discord servers, and move on to more sophisticated tools.\n\n\n  Reflections: Stepping Back and Moving Forward\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin\n\n\n  Down the @TheCryptoconomy Rabbithole - Essential Bitcoin Literature in Audio Format\n  Running Bitcoin: Tools, Apps and Guides\n  LightniNgFo: Wallets, Applications, Guides and Development\n\n\nBitcoin History\n\n\n  Electronic Cash and Virtual Currencies, Before Bitcoin\n  Cypherpunks and the Crypto Wars\n  Blockchain and the United Nations\n  History of Permissioned Ledgers\n\n\nTranscripts\n\nAround a year ago, I started making transcripts for content that I felt was too valuable to be left in audio format only. More recently, starting with Mark Miller and David Chaum, I’ve started going wild adding links for more information on the discussed topics.\n\n\n  Mark Miller, Agoric and the Decades-Long Quest for Secure Smart Contracts\n  David Chaum - Forefather of Cryptocurrencies and the Cypherpunk Movement\n  Smart Signatures - Christopher Allen\n  Public vs Private Blockchains for the Enterprise\n  JW Weatherman Interviews Cypherpunk Legend Timothy C May\n  Stephan Levira Podcast 53 - Andreas M.

  "content"  : "The more you are able to leverage digital tools, the greater your potential in the digital world. The easiest tools have a graphical interface, and the really good ones cost money. But gaining familiarity with your terminal applications is where the power is at. You don’t have to be a developer to learn how to use their tools and gain access to features that otherwise would cost an arm and a leg. This is the edge.\n\nYour physical efforts with a desktop application, having 0 barrier to entry, is a commodity.\n\nDigital tools are a force multiplier.\n\nNot only command-line tools.  Then there are a multitude of fully featured web-apps that are free for personal use. There is so much growth potential in the digital tools which are developed faster than the technical user-base.\n\nWeb-work.tools is where I save information for my own personal reference, and anyone else who’s interested.\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation for the Commons\n\nSince the explosion of the web, traditional enterprise has found itself continually under fire. Every executive worth their salt knows that anyone with an internet connection has the potential to decimate their entire industry, with some new disintermediating product or service.\n\nRecall, that some of the largest corporations existing today were built in a garage.\n\nThe enterprise has considerable resources devoted to undergoing their own digital transformation, to distrupt their own business models before someone else does it for them.\n\nNow, the independent would-be worker of the web isn’t likely to know all of this. When I began, all I knew is that it’s clearly possible to work online, not only that, it’s practically inevitable.\n\nToday there is an endless array of useful tools and apps that you and I can learn to create value with. You don’t need money, you just need time, a computer and an internet connection.\n\nFeatured Content\n\n  Github Pages Starter Pack\n    \n      Github Pages Extended Resources\n    \n  \n  Hugo Starter Kit\n  Learn SEO\n    \n      100’s of Mostly Free SEO Tools\n    \n  \n\n\nIndieweb Curated\n\n  IndieWeb Resources\n  IndieWeb GitHub Repositories\n  FreeNode IRC #indieweb-dev on IIW RWoT and DID’s\n  Indigo Authors - Indiweb Features\n\n\nIndieweb is all about taking control of your content, and all kinda stuff I’m just beginning to grok.\n"
