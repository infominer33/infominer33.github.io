&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what exactly have I doing with all that time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developing-the-backend-for-a-sustainable-weekly-newsletter&quot;&gt;Developing the backend for a sustainable weekly newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been chatting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://identitywoman.net/&quot;&gt;Kaliya Identity Woman&lt;/a&gt; for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://identosphere.net&quot;&gt;Identosphere.net&lt;/a&gt; domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of jumping in head first, like I usually do, we’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter, sustainably, with as few third party services as possible, while I’m learning my way around various web-tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and I’d like to share this process for others to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-pages&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awsome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages Starter Pack&lt;/a&gt;  (a resource I’ve created along that journey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static Websites are great for security and easy to set up, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-staticman&quot;&gt;Enter Staticman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman&quot;&gt;Staticman&lt;/a&gt; is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server.  Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailgun.com/&quot;&gt;mailgun&lt;/a&gt; integration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set it up on my own server and created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html&quot;&gt;bot account on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made the form, and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;staticman.yml&lt;/code&gt; config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-subscription-form&quot;&gt;The Subscription Form&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Subscribe for Updates&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;form class=&quot;staticman&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;options[redirect]&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;https://infominer.xyz/subscribed&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;options[slug]&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;infohub&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;fields[name]&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name (optional)&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;fields[email]&quot; type=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;fields[message]&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Areas of Interest (optional)&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input name=&quot;links&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; placeholder=&quot;links&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&amp;gt;Subscribe&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-staticmanyml-config-in-the-root-of-my-private-subscribe-repo&quot;&gt;The staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;subscribe:
  allowedFields: [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, &quot;message&quot;]
  allowedOrigins: [&quot;infominer.xyz&quot;,&quot;identosphere.net&quot;]
  branch: &quot;master&quot;
  commitMessage: &quot;New subscriber: {fields.name}&quot;
  filename: &quot;subscribe-{@timestamp}&quot;
  format: &quot;yaml&quot;
  generatedFields:
    date:
      type: &quot;date&quot;
      options:
        format: &quot;iso8601&quot; 
  moderation: false
  name: &quot;infominer.xyz&quot;
  path: &quot;{options.slug}&quot; 
  requiredFields: [&quot;email&quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/366#issuecomment-726016008&quot;&gt;struggling with GitHub’s recent move&lt;/a&gt; to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planet-pluto-feed-reader&quot;&gt;Planet Pluto Feed Reader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to keep up with Self-Sovereign Identity, kaliya and I started out with Feedly, but the pricing for collaborative feed creation is nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/i/pro/welcome&quot;&gt;$50 a month&lt;/a&gt; for two users. There was no way I could go with that for very long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto&quot;&gt;Planet Pluto Feed Reader&lt;/a&gt;, by Gerald Bauer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)&quot;&gt;Planet (Software)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, I should add that websites generate RSS feeds that can be read by a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually. You very likely use RSS all the time without knowing, for example, your podcast player depends on RSS feeds to bring episodes directly to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feedreader/&quot;&gt;Pluto Feed reader&lt;/a&gt; does is just like your podcast app, except, instead of an application on your phone that only you can browse, it builds a simple webpage from the feeds you add to it, that can be published on GitHub, your favorite static web-hosting service, or on your own server in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://planet-templates.github.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/planet-templates/planet-hacker/master/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluto is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/&quot;&gt;ERB templating&lt;/a&gt; language for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/planet-templates&quot;&gt;web-page design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feed-search&quot;&gt;Feed Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar&quot;&gt;RSSHub Radar&lt;/a&gt; browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, install the package with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/pip/&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip install feedsearch-crawler&lt;/code&gt;), and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python feedsearch.py&lt;/code&gt;,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feedsearch-crawler&quot;&gt;Feedsearch Crawler&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler&quot;&gt;DBeath/feedsearch-crawler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename=&apos;example.log&apos;,level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = [&quot;http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/&quot;,&quot;http://blockchainespana.com/&quot;,&quot;http://blog.deanland.com/&quot;]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger(&quot;feedsearch_crawler&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feed-seeker&quot;&gt;Feed seeker&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker&quot;&gt;mitmedialab/feed_seeker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = [&quot;http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/&quot;,&quot;http://blockchainespana.com/&quot;,&quot;http://blog.deanland.com/&quot;]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/setup-python&quot;&gt;GitHub actions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: Build BlogCatcher
on:
  schedule:
    # This action runs 4x a day.
    - cron:  &apos;0/60 */4 * * *&apos;
  push:
    paths:
    # It also runs whenever I add a new feed to Pluto&apos;s config file.
    - &apos;planetid.ini&apos;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identosphere-blogcatcher&quot;&gt;Identosphere Blogcatcher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://infominer.xyz/assets/img/identosphere-blogcatcher.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher&quot;&gt;Identosphere Blogcatcher&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/&quot;&gt;Planet Identity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a page for &lt;a href=&quot;https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/companies/&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;, and another for &lt;a href=&quot;https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/organizations/&quot;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; working in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identosphere-weekly-highlights&quot;&gt;Identosphere Weekly Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/identitywoman&quot;&gt;Kaliya&lt;/a&gt; suggested that since we have these pages up and running smoothly, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the backend information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every weekend we get together, browse the BlogCatcher, and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://infominer.xyz/assets/img/identosphere-stats.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identospheresubstackcom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://identosphere.substack.com/&quot;&gt;identosphere.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;support-us-on-patreon&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/identosphere&quot;&gt;Support us on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/identosphere&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/identosphere-patreon.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Become a patron&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;python-twitter-api-and-github-actions&quot;&gt;Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a simple guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/&quot;&gt;How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy&lt;/a&gt; composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yaml.org/&quot;&gt;yaml&lt;/a&gt; file, and then used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/setup-python&quot;&gt;GitHub actions&lt;/a&gt; to run the script on a regular schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralized-id-weekly-twitter-collections&quot;&gt;Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/&quot;&gt;back to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c&quot;&gt;a script that searches twitter&lt;/a&gt; for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df&quot;&gt;twitter collection&lt;/a&gt;, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, these will be regularly published to &lt;a href=&quot;https://decentralized-id.com&quot;&gt;decentralized-id.com&lt;/a&gt;, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter-collections-ive-made-so-far&quot;&gt;Twitter collections I’ve made so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057&quot;&gt;Self Sovereign ID 101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520&quot;&gt;October Week 5 #SSI #DID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralized-idcom&quot;&gt;Decentralized-ID.com&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://decentralized-id.com/posts/&quot;&gt;decentralized-id.com&lt;/a&gt;, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I’ve not given up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinfo.xyz&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecrypto.pub&quot;&gt;Crypto&lt;/a&gt;. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web-work.tools&quot;&gt;web-work.tools&lt;/a&gt; was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;

So what exactly have I doing with all that time?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Little About Me</title><link href="https://infominer.xyz/about/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Little About Me" /><published>2019-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://infominer.xyz/about</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://infominer.xyz/about/">&lt;p&gt;I became captivated with computers in the early-mid ’90s, as the world wide web began to reach the consumer market. I was a total computer nerd, but never took it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no conception of how the world would be transformed, and ultimately decided that technology was simply one of many potential material pursuits. I took off to gather experience and pursue meaning, which kept me apart from the tech I loved, for most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QzUQ3fF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;after-years-bereft-of-meaningful-direction-i-needed-a-re-boot&quot;&gt;After years bereft of meaningful direction, I needed a re-boot.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding safe haven where I could freely pursue a new direction and self-education. While I had been paying scant attention to the broader cultural movements or the advance of personal computing, the world had become transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling the pain of lost opportunities, I quickly realized I could have done almost anything if I had gotten serious about tech as a kid, I could have built a much nicer life for myself by that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I could see that the world has only begun its digital transformation, and opportunity abounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved to read and consume information, so I began writing freelance, in order to make some money while educating myself. If I could get paid to read, I thought… Now, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be the ticket!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I hadn’t spent much time with the written word in a while, could barely keep my eyes focused on the screen, and I didn’t know anything about the modern tech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-some-markdown-and-get-blogging&quot;&gt;Learn some markdown, and get blogging!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My style was rough, to start, but my dedication to internet search and relating accurate and precise information landed me some content gigs related to bitcoin and data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got fed up with all the mindless drivel dominating search results and decided to start keeping track of valuable information. Since I used only a fraction of my research for the actual content I was preparing, I thought I might make an alliance with writers in need of quality citations for information surrounding these actively emerging industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it’s a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love information discovery and keeping track of fast moving information streams a lot more than I like writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curated-lists-the-gold-of-the-internet&quot;&gt;Curated Lists: the Gold of the Internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that’s even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I thought “what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest.” This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but no-one is really tackling the problem head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation is just eating up jobs left and right, while curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can’t automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see internet research and digital curation as making up a potentially massive portion of the future labor markets.&lt;/strong&gt; This huge sector of the economy just waiting to transform the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;id-like-to-nurture-that-potential-and-help-to-create-that-reality&quot;&gt;I’d like to nurture that potential and help to create that reality!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A bigger wikipedia isn’t the answer, but a wikipedia full of curated lists might be a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in the channels of a discord server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/pexels_pixabay_sea-gc2c7fabd8_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-reasonably-comprehensive-grasp&quot;&gt;A reasonably comprehensive grasp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grasp of so many subjects is required for a reasonably comprehensive understanding of blockchain, cryptocurrency and relevant tech trends; eventually I broke my inquiry apart into multiple categories which spread across a dozen discord organizations with associated twitter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned to follow the professionals and organizations working in each field, using the retweet button to bookmark interesting posts, whose content I could review later with a fresh set of eyes for its substance and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never assumed that I could actually accomplish the task, but I felt it was important to act and believe as though it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I grew up a total computer nerd, I drifted from that early passion for many years, and only got &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; about tech, more recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had quite a steep learning curve trying to catch up, but I paired that with an infinite curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-collaborative-workflow&quot;&gt;A Collaborative Workflow?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin, in a comprehensive fashion, still seems foolish. Then again, it doesn’t seen quite so foolish as it did, when I began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve recieved assistance, in one form or another from a handful of contributors, the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not always felt very social, or acted as an effective organizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foss-ideals-vs-pragmatism&quot;&gt;FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony of a dependence on discord and twitter while laying a foundation for a &lt;em&gt;Free and Open Source&lt;/em&gt; (FOSS) principled collaborative curation platform is not lost on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter has played an essential component of my education, and is a primary public sphere for discourse on most of the subjects I’ve been studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it’s shortcomings, there is plenty of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a litte better while searching for a resonable replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheets are extensible, and make an ideal stepping stone between unordered lists and a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also begun to include Notion as an integral component of my workflow. It allows me to easily transform html into markdown, which is perfect from all the enriched content I’ve been pulling from the social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think a wiki of curated lists is a solid direction to aim towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taking-a-break-from-socials&quot;&gt;Taking a Break from Socials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just been going full blast, trying to make up for lost time. Now its time for me to reassess my workflow, and figure out what is the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new tools, and take it all to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found myself enthralled by the intoxicating streams of information surrounding Bitcoin, in 2017. I began that journey by studying the histories of related subjects: Cryptography, Programming, Web Standards, Digital Cash; while developing my technical skills with freelance work, and building small websites on related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying history is my antidote to the exceeding complexity of life. While Bitcoin and its network are rather complex to wrap your head around, learning about the history of cryptography makes it a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you proceed to study the history of other relevant subjects: from the global economy, wall street, and the creation of money; to the timeline and basic details surrounding the creation of various programming languages, little by little, Bitcoin becomes much easier to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-few-markdown-files&quot;&gt;A few markdown files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project began as a few markdown files in my first github repository, that gradually evolved into my homepage. I needed space for my endless curiosity to grow, and splitting the content off to multiple websites also helped me to develop my skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each step I have used my interests to fuel my education and learned many difficult things for the ability share knowledge I’ve gathered, and increase my value in this rapidly evolving digital sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/infohub-transformed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all of my content, and forked repositories, have become divided between a variety of GitHub Organizations and my user account. This makes it easy to publish websites built from multiple custom domains, without the need to rent server space for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-will-keep-building&quot;&gt;I will keep building!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always hoped that I might find others interested in helping to create these resources, but appreciate that others may prefer to quietly gather resources for their own projects, and it could always get easier to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I like moving around information, organizing it in different ways, expanding my reach in the digital sphere, and experimenting with different ways of sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects have tended to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-transformation&quot;&gt;The transformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page is meant to be a top level index of projects I’m working on, transfomed from a rough list of links beginning to explore the above subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my homepage is always the last to know about anything, and I’m not always working directly on these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, whenever there are significant updates, I am making efforts to keep this content as current and relevant to my work as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>⧉ infominer</name></author><summary type="html">I&apos;ve found myself enthralled by intoxicating ecosystems of knowledge surrounding Bitcoin.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowledge-defies-categorization&quot;&gt;Knowledge Defies Categorization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge I encountered is that information wont be neatly divided into categories. Fields of knowledge are all overlapping, and a given post will fit within multiple categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I came to understand is that I should use some type of structured data, so that I required only a single entry of an item in the data file, for it to be featured within multiple categories, once the finished product was rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;infominer-meets-structured-data&quot;&gt;Infominer meets Structured Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I began, I didn’t really know much about types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided upon TOML because it’s user-friendly, and easy to read. Once data is structured in this way, it can be transformed to JSON, or whichever format works best for a given project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page has two toml files from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto&quot;&gt;infominer33/SourceCrypto&lt;/a&gt; embedded into it, marking a beginning in my effort to enhance my curation and publishing through automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been good with a computer, but this was entering me into an entirely new domain. At the time of publication is when I began learning how to publish websites and use developers tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-direction&quot;&gt;Future Direction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;some simple way to check &lt;a href=&quot;https://decentralized-id.com&quot;&gt;didecentral.github.io&lt;/a&gt; against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata..&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Crossing out these items, as now I can manage these tasks with python)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Scraping a list of links from wherever I want is simple.. so really the two things are checking a list of links against a toml file(s), outputting any links not found in the db already. Another script to construct a toml file grabbing metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time I didn’t come to the logical conclusion of how easy it could have been to generate content based on the files embedded here. I was just getting in way over my head, and was hopeful someone coder would catch my enthusiasm and make the code for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it has worked out fine and in 2023, finally coming around to this idea: full-circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;algorithmic-tagging&quot;&gt;Algorithmic tagging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;what’s really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.8960&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;Enabling Author-Centric Ranking of Web Content&lt;/a&gt; - @MaciekLaskus on twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I get the infrastructure in place that will be next on my list. Even simply downloading all of the links and generating a keyword list for each could get us a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-identity---data&quot;&gt;Blockchain Identity - Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These files were compiled, in part, as a result of a project I collaborated on, at the end of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, all of this work was quite inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Original&lt;/em&gt; Blockchain Identity list on GitHub, originally compiled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peacekeeper/&quot;&gt;Markus Sabadello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity&quot;&gt;/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leaned heavily on this repository when first learning about decentralized identity and blockchain. I went over his whole list and updated links, brining in additional relevant resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain-idtoml&quot;&gt;blockchain-id.toml&lt;/h3&gt;
