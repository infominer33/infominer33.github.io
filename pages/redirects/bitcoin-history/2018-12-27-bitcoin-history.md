For now this is just an assorted list. Shortly I'll be diving deeper into the history of bitcoin itself. Thusfar, I've been circling around it, so to speak. I've been gathering all of the necessary background research, in order to do justice to the story of Bitcoin itself


* [Bitcoin's Origins and the Genesis Blockade](https://youtu.be/cagoyF3WePo)
  > "In this talk, Andreas recounts the origins of Bitcoin, the meaning of the message embedded forever in its genesis block, and how we figured out who the banks truly serve when there was no other choice. He also speaks about what happens when money stops working, why censorship resistance was one of Bitcoin's most valuable characteristics from the start, and what possibilities lay in store with a global, voluntary financial system."
* [Genesis Block Newspaper](https://www.thetimes03jan2009.com/) 
  > "The only two remaining verified complete copies of this newspaper were acquired from the London National Archives on January 14, 2014. The newspapers come in a complete set with both the cover and the entire newspaper included. 
  
* [@lopp on Bitcoin History](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1023689161096785920) - Bitcoin whitepaper purists should take note that the following things are NOT described in the whitepaper: 
  * multisig
  * mining pools
  * 21M coin cap
  * GPU & ASIC mining
  * 10 minute block times
  * HD address generation
  * best chain = cumulative PoW, not longest chain
  * and much, much more..


* [@PeterLBrandt on 'Bubbles'](https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1030884169763549184) - Us old-timers always considered a decline greater than 80% to be a bubble that popped. Most altcoins must be legitimately considered as bubbles that popped. The dead-cat bounces from the resulting decimation can be wicked.

* [Bitcoin History: Timeline, Origins and Founder](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bitcoin/bitcoin-history-14686578)
  > "The history of Bitcoin has been a turbulent one to say the least, and right now we're in one of the most turbulent periods in its history, as it has spent the entirety of 2018 falling further and further from its peak value of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.\n\nBut something as uncertain as Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) was never going to be smooth sailing. Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.\n\nBut how did we get to where we are today with Bitcoin? How did it begin, what were its forebearers, and what have been the unexpected turns of the Bitcoin journey? Let's take a walk through the timeline and find out."

  >"I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell."

* [Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062572066/digital-gold/)
  > "Bitcoin, the landmark digital money and financial technology, has spawned a global social movement with utopian ambitions. The notion of a new currency, maintained by the computers of users around the world, has been the butt of many jokes, but that has not stopped it from growing into a technology worth billions of dollars, supported by the hordes of followers who have come to view it as the most important new idea since the creation of the Internet."

* [Bitcoin is not Dead](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/06/bitcoin-is-not-dead/#355f465b5bdd)
  > "The first recorded claim of bitcoin’s demise was in 2010, on a little-known blog that found itself posted on a record of “bitcoin obituaries” collected by 99Bitcoins, a bitcoin information site. While I consider myself among the first wave of bitcoin writers, having written my first article on the subject in 2011, this early claim of bitcoin’s death came when the cryptocurrency was valued at only $0.23. It is now worth almost $7,000."

* [Bitcoin Stumble Shows Bitmain a Ghost of Crises Past](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-09-18/bitcoin-stumble-shows-bitmain-a-ghost-of-crises-past)
  > "A look at Bitmain Technologies Ltd.’s financials reveal the Chinese company sold a lot of shovels during the crypto gold rush of the past two years. Its mistake was to take digital gold as payment instead of cash. \n\nBut there are two other items that could make matters worse for Bitmain and others in the crypto-mining ecosystem, adding to pressure on the balance sheet."

* [@varun_mathur on RSS history's compared to Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/varun_mathur/status/1038107664868208640)
  > "Crypto’s RSS Era About 10 yrs ago, before the advent of bitcoin, the tech world was coming to grips with how RSS failed to take off as a consumer tech. I spent 2 yrs of my life building the best (?)feed reader UX, but I was solving for local maxima, not global maximum (industry)"

* [Bitcoin’s Constitutional Crisis & Why I Support the UASF](https://medium.com/tbis-weekly-bits/bitcoins-constitutional-crisis-why-i-support-the-uasf-5b0ab325d8b6)
Description = "It took three years and the emergence of serious (and perhaps permanent) crypto rivals, but there finally seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel in this round of the bitcoin scaling debate. Thank god.\n\nThe impending activation of BIP 148, AKA bitcoin’s “user activated soft fork”, due to take effect on August 1, would ensure that SegWit, an optimization feature that increases block capacity, gets activated without strings attached."

  > "Rusty Russell, a well known and respected Bitcoin Lightning developer at Blockstream  joins me in this episode. We talk about his article, The Three Economic Eras of Bitcoin, and discuss the Lightning Network for Bitcoin. Lastly, Rusty draws from his prior experience as a Linux kernel developer to contrast Linux development with Bitcoin and Lightning development practices and culture."

* [Satoshi on Anonymous Transactions - bitcointalk](https://twitter.com/notgrubles/status/1043569394901602304) [[**ϟ**](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=770.msg9074)
  > "As some might have noticed, one of the things that bugs me about bitcoin is that the entire history of transactions is completely public. I totally understand the benefits of how this simplifies things and makes it easy for everyone to prove coins are valid. So this is not a suggestion for a change to bitcoin. Rather it is a question about what could be possible, and what couldn't be possible."


* [@BitcoinErrorLog on the original Bitcoin Foundation](https://twitter.com/BitcoinErrorLog/status/1044207811603943425)
  > "I was a paying member of the original Bitcoin Foundation. They were mostly a train wreck. I attended their annual meeting at a conference in Amsterdam and met with their accounting person to ask some hard questions. She was actually pretty savvy. /1"

  > "Vitalik Buterin is a former computer science student who dropped out of college to focus on bitcoin projects full-time. He was a very early bitcoin adopter and is currently the head writer at Bitcoin Magazine. Listen as Vitalik discusses his background, how he got involved in bitcoin and why he thinks bitcoin has the potential to change the world! This interview is one in a series captured at the Media Bistro Inside Bitcoins Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, December 10th and 11th, 2013"

* [A finite monetary supply for Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki)
  > "Although it is widely believed that Satoshi was an inflation-hating goldbug he never said this, and in fact programmed Bitcoin's money supply to grow indefinitely, forever. He modeled the monetary supply as 4 gold mines being discovered per mibillenium (1024 years), with equal intervals between them, each one being depleted over the course of 140 years. This poses obvious problems, however. Prominent among them is the discussion on what to call 1 billion Bitcoin, which symbol color to use for it, and when wallet clients should switch to it by default. To combat this, this document proposes a controversial change: making Bitcoin's monetary supply finite."

### Bitcoin 2.0

Is a term that came about around 2014 to describe crypto projects beyond Bitcoin the currency. Some leveraging the Bitcoin Blockchain, some creating their own networks.
