# Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) 
**Literature associated with the Fundamentals of Self-Sovereign Identity.**

This directory was born from [/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity), the original SSI repository. 

The reason I got started on this is because I wanted to write an article about SSI, and saw some areas where I could help with some of the legwork towards a more complete, and up-to-date set of SSI literature.


In my opinion, the best overall article on the subject is still Christopher Allen's rallying cry: [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md). Christopher did an outstanding job of outlining the history of internet identity standards, and introduces [10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md), currently in revision. 

However, considerable additional material has been created on the subject since then, including some helpful criticism on the principles. I've organized some of my initial thoughts in [evolution-of-ssi](evolution-of-ssi/).

Then I realized that I should make a more complete survey of the subject, if I want to be thorough. So now I'm collecting as much SSI info as I can, and organizing it here. Once I've completed a review of existing literature on the subject, I'll put it into a google shared doc to encourage further participation.
